libdata[libdataItem++] = new Array("./jupiter_example.html", "jupiter_example.pro", '.pro file in <a href="./dir-overview.html">./ directory</a>', "jupiter_example.pro", "", "", " JUPITER EXAMPLE     Edited by Mark Moretto     June 2016      This example file uses an image of Jupiter, its rings, and satellites to     demonstrate various capabilities of the OMINAS software.  This includes     fitting the limb and rings simultaneously, hiding the limb and/or rings wrt     other objects in the field of view, plotting radial and longitudinal     sectors on the ring and generating map projections.      This example file can be executed from the UNIX command line using: <span class= code-output >idl jupiter.example</span>     or from within IDL using: <span class= code-output >@jupiter.example</span>     After the example stops, later code samples in this file may be executed by     pasting them onto the IDL command line.   Read and display image        This first section uses dat_read to read in the image and then displays    the image using tvim.     dat_read reads the image portion (im) and the label (label) and returns a    data descriptor (dd) containing the image and label and information obtained    through OMINAS' configuration tables.  If a file exists in the same directory    and with the same name as the image, except with the extension  .dh ,    then it is assumed to be a detached header and it is read as well.     The files w1352097259.1 and n1352037683.2 are Cassini wide- and narrow-    angle frames of Jupiter.  2000r.img and 2100r.img are Galileo SSI    images of Ganymede.     ctmod is called to reserve several colors in the case of an 8-bit display.     tvim is called to display the image (im) in a new window with the y    coordinate as top-down: <span class= code-output > file = 'data/N1350122987_2.IMG'</span> <span class= code-output > dd = dat_read(file, im, label, /silent)</span> <span class= code-output > ctmod, top=top</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, im, zoom=0.75, /order, /new, top=top</span>   Obtain descriptors     This section obtains the camera descriptor (cd), planet descriptors    (pd), ring descriptors (rd), and the sun descriptor (sund) for    use with subsequent commands: <span class= code-output > cd = pg_get_cameras(dd)</span> <span class= code-output > pd = pg_get_planets(dd, od=cd)</span> <span class= code-output > rd = pg_get_rings(dd, pd=pd, od=cd)</span> <span class= code-output > sund = pg_get_stars(dd, od=cd, name='SUN')</span>   NOTES     Because the detached header translator dh_std_input appears before    the Cassini Spice input translator in the default translators table, the    descriptors are taken from the detached header if it exists.  If it doesn't    exist, then they are obtained through the SPICE kernels.     The commented lines shows how translator keywords can be passed to    override the keywords given in the translators table.     The keyword 'name' could be used in pg_get_planets to select only Jupiter    and the Galilean satellites.  By default, every body that's relevant to    the mission and can be found in the kernel list is returned.  Also, the    SPICE translator organizes the pd array such that pd[0] gives the    primary target of the observation, if one exists.     The keyword 'name' is used in pg_get_stars to select only the Sun.    Otherwise, star catalog stars would also be returned.  Note, however,    that the star catalog is still searched because it does appear in the    translators table.   Create a generic descriptor     This line creates a  generic  descriptor.  This is a convenience    feature wherein several descriptors are grouped into a structure that    can be passed to functions in one piece.  The field names of a generic    descriptor must follow the convention described in pg_description.txt: <span class= code-output > gd = {cd:cd, gbx:pd, dkx:rd, sund:sund}</span>    cd - camera descriptor part     gbx - globe descriptor part     dkx - disk descriptor part     sund - sun descriptor part   Compute geometric features     These commands compute the limb of each planet, the edges of the Jovian ring    system, and terminators on each planet: <span class= code-output > limb_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd) & pg_hide, limb_ptd, gd=gd, /rm, /disk</span> <span class= code-output >           pg_hide, limb_ptd, /limb, gd=gd, od=sund</span> <span class= code-output > ring_ptd = pg_disk(gd=gd) & pg_hide, ring_ptd, gd=gd, /globe</span> <span class= code-output > term_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd, od=gd.sund) & pg_hide, term_ptd, gd=gd, /limb</span>  <span class= code-output > center_ptd = pg_center(gd=gd, bx=pd)</span> <span class= code-output > center_o=pnt_points(center_ptd[0])    ;get the center of Jupiter from the points object</span> <span class= code-output > print, center_o                       ;display the center of Jupiter</span> <span class= code-output > object_ptd = [center_ptd,limb_ptd,ring_ptd,term_ptd]</span>    Note that terminators are computed    using pg_limb by specifying the sun as the observer instead of the camera.   Set plot parameters     The colors, psyms, psizes and plables variables    are defined for the plot.  The center is drawn in the default color    (!p.color), the limb is in yellow (ctyellow) and the inner and outer ring    are in red (ctred).  Here you can see that each ring is treated as two    objects (inner and outer) when defining plot characteristics.  With an    8-bit display, these color routines return the values that were previously    reserved in the color table with ctmod; with a 24-bit display, these    routines return the true color values for these colors.  nlimb stores the    number of points in the limb_ptd structure, nring, the number of points in    the ring point structure.  In plabels, the limb and ring's name is not    plotted since it would be plotted at the center of the object: <span class= code-output > ncent=n_elements(center_ptd)</span> <span class= code-output > nlimb=n_elements(limb_ptd)</span> <span class= code-output > nring=n_elements(ring_ptd)</span> <span class= code-output > nterm=n_elements(term_ptd)</span> <span class= code-output > colors=[make_array(n_elements(pd),value=!p.color), $</span> <span class= code-output >         make_array(n_elements(pd),value=ctyellow()), $</span> <span class= code-output >         make_array(2*n_elements(rd),value=ctred()), $</span> <span class= code-output >         make_array(nterm,value=ctgreen())]</span> <span class= code-output > psyms=[make_array(n_elements(pd),value=1), $</span> <span class= code-output >         make_array(n_elements(pd),value=3), $</span> <span class= code-output >         make_array(2*n_elements(rd),value=3), $</span> <span class= code-output >         make_array(nterm,value=3)]</span> <span class= code-output > psizes=1.0</span> <span class= code-output > csizes=0.75</span> <span class= code-output > plabels=[cor_name(pd), $</span> <span class= code-output >         make_array(n_elements(pd),value=''), $</span> <span class= code-output >         make_array(2*n_elements(rd),value=''), $</span> <span class= code-output >         make_array(nterm,value='')]</span>   Draw the limb, ring and planet center      This section draws the objects in the object array (center, limb, ring,  and terminator) with the colors and plot symbols and labels defined earlier: <span class= code-output >   pg_draw, object_ptd, col=colors, psy=psyms, psi=psizes, csi=csizes, pl=plabels</span>   First-cut Automatic repointing   Refine the pointing of the spacecraft by using pg_farfit, which searches  the whole image for a pattern matching the edges calculated using the  descriptors: <span class= code-output >   edge_ptd = pg_edges(dd, edge=10)                ; Scan image for edges.</span> <span class= code-output >   pg_draw, edge_ptd</span> <span class= code-output >   dxy = pg_farfit(dd, edge_ptd, [limb_ptd[0]])    ; Try to correlate scanned edges with the computed limb.</span> <span class= code-output >   pg_repoint, dxy, 0d, axis=center_ptd[0], gd=gd  ; Change the pointing.</span> <span class= code-output >   tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output >   pg_draw, object_ptd, colors=colors, psyms=psyms, psizes=psizes, plabel=plabels</span>  <span class= code-output >   center_ptd = pg_center(gd=gd, bx=pd)</span> <span class= code-output >   print, 'after automatic repointing, the center was shifted by:', pnt_points(center_ptd[0])-center_o, 'pixels'</span>    Manually repoint the geometry     This pasteable section first clears the screen of the plotted points    by redisplaying the image with tvim.  It then calls pg_drag to allow    the user to use the cursor to drag the pointing, and with it the limb,    ring and planet center.  To move the pointing with pg_drag, use the left    mouse button and translate the pointing in x,y.  Use the middle mouse    button to rotate the pointing about an axis (in this case, the axis of    rotation is set as the planet center (center_ptd[0]).  When the    desired pointing is set, the right mouse button accepts it.  pg_drag    returns the delta x,y amount dragged (dxy) as well as the rotation    angle (dtheta).  pg_repoint uses the dxy and dtheta to update the    camera descriptor (cd, passed by gd).  The limb and center is then    recalculated, the image redisplayed to clear the objects drawn, and    then pg_draw is called to replot: <span class= code-output > tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output > dxy = pg_drag(object_ptd, dtheta=dtheta, axis=center_ptd[0])    ;Do the reponting</span> <span class= code-output > pg_repoint, dxy, dtheta, axis=center_ptd[0], gd=gd              ;Modify the general descriptor</span>  <span class= code-output > ;Recalculate the geometry and redisplay the image with the new overlays</span>  <span class= code-output > limb_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd) & pg_hide, limb_ptd, gd=gd, /rm, /disk</span> <span class= code-output >        pg_hide, limb_ptd, /limb, gd=gd, od=sund</span> <span class= code-output > ring_ptd = pg_disk(gd=gd) & pg_hide, ring_ptd, gd=gd, /globe</span> <span class= code-output > center_ptd = pg_center(gd=gd, bx=pd)</span> <span class= code-output > term_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd, od=gd.sund) & pg_hide, term_ptd, gd=gd, /limb</span> <span class= code-output > object_ptd = [center_ptd,limb_ptd,ring_ptd,term_ptd]</span>  <span class= code-output > tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, object_ptd, colors=colors, psyms=psyms, psizes=psizes, plabel=plabels</span>   Scan the edge to find the limb and use it to correct the pointing using least-squares.     This section calls pg_cvscan to scan the image around the predicted    limb position and the ring edge position (within width of 80 pixels) and    find the points of highest correlation with a given edge model for each    object (edge_model_nav_limb = limb model used in the VICAR program NAV    and edge_model_nav_ring = ring model from NAV) and zeropoint offset in    the given model (lzero).  These points are then plotted: <span class= code-output > cvscan_ptd=pg_cvscan(dd, gd=gd, [limb_ptd[0]], edge=30, width=80, $</span> <span class= code-output >     model=[make_array(nlimb,val=ptr_new(edge_model_nav_limb(zero=lzero)))], $</span> <span class= code-output >     mzero=[make_array(nlimb,val=lzero)] )</span>  <span class= code-output > ; cvscan_ptd=pg_cvscan(dd, [limb_ptd], edge=30, width=20, $</span> <span class= code-output > ;    model=[make_array(nlimb,val=ptr_new(edge_model_atan(10,5, zero=lzero)))], $</span> <span class= code-output > ;    mzero=[make_array(nlimb,val=lzero)] )</span>  <span class= code-output > tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, cvscan_ptd</span>    The commented command might be more appropriate for images in which    the planet disk is quite small.  In that case, we use a different edge    model (because the nav model cannot be scaled) and we scan a much    narrower region.   Threshold on correlation coefficient     This section calls pg_threshold to remove points with    unacceptable correlation coefficients.  The /relative flag means that    the minimum and maximum thresholds are taken as a fraction of the maximum    correlation coefficient for each set of points. In this case we use a minimun    correlation coefficent of 0.81 and a maximum of 1.0: <span class= code-output > pg_threshold, cvscan_ptd, min=0.81, max=1.0, /rel</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, cvscan_ptd</span>   Removing regions of bad scan points     This pasteable section calls pg_select to remove points within a    polygonal region as defined by the cursor.  Click the left mouse    button to mark a point and move the mouse to the next point and    click.  Use the middle mouse button to erase a point and the right    mouse button to end the region.  pg_trim removes the points in the    just defined region.  The scan points are then replotted.    Repeat these statements for each region a user wants to remove: <span class= code-output > region = pg_select(dd)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_trim, dd, cvscan_ptd, region</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, cvscan_ptd</span>   Fit the pointing to the scanned points using least squares     This section calls pg_cvscan_coeff to determine the linear least-squares    coefficients for a fit to the image coordinate translation and rotation    that matches the computed curve to the scanned curve. It then calls    pg_fit to do the fit with the calculated coefficients to calculate the    correction in translation (dxy) and rotation (dtheta).  It calls    pg_cvchisq to get the chi square of the fit.  Then calls pg_repoint to    update the pointing. Recalculates the limb and center and replots.    The determination of the curves and their subsequent fit can be    iterated on.     Note that, as shown, dx, dy, and dtheta are fit.  To fix any of these    parameters use the 'fix' keyword to pg_cvscan_coeff.  For example    with 'fix=2', dtheta will be zero: <span class= code-output > fix = [2]</span> <span class= code-output > cvscan_cf = pg_cvscan_coeff(cvscan_ptd, axis=center_ptd[0], fix=fix)</span> <span class= code-output > dxy = pg_fit([cvscan_cf], dtheta=dtheta)</span> <span class= code-output > chisq = pg_chisq(dxy, dtheta, cvscan_ptd, axis=center_ptd[0], fix=fix)</span> <span class= code-output > covar = pg_covariance([cvscan_cf])</span> <span class= code-output > print, dxy, dtheta*180./!pi, chisq, covar</span> <span class= code-output > pg_repoint, dxy, dtheta, axis=center_ptd[0], gd=gd</span>  <span class= code-output > limb_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd) & pg_hide, limb_ptd, gd=gd, /rm, /disk</span> <span class= code-output >         pg_hide, limb_ptd, /limb, gd=gd, od=sund</span> <span class= code-output > ring_ptd = pg_disk(gd=gd) & pg_hide, ring_ptd, gd=gd, /globe</span> <span class= code-output > center_ptd = pg_center(gd=gd, bx=pd)</span> <span class= code-output > term_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd, od=gd.sund) & pg_hide, term_ptd, gd=gd, /limb</span> <span class= code-output > object_ptd = [center_ptd,limb_ptd,ring_ptd,term_ptd]</span>  <span class= code-output > tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, object_ptd, colors=colors, psyms=psyms, psizes=psizes, plabel=plabels</span>   Draw planet and ring latitude/longitude grid        This sections calculates a latitude/longitude grid for each planet and a    radius/longitude grid for the rings.  By default it draws 12 latitude    and 12 longitude grid lines.  The longitude grid lines circle the body    and so on a map they will appear as 24 grid lines.  The ring radius grid    uses four grid lines by default between the inner and outer ring radius.    It uses pg_hide to set as not visible the points on the grid behind the    planet and ring for both objects.  It then uses pg_draw to draw the    grid points in blue (ctblue): <span class= code-output > grid_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gd, lat=lat, lon=lon)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_hide, grid_ptd, cd=cd, gbx=pd, /limb</span> <span class= code-output > pg_hide, grid_ptd, cd=cd, gbx=pd, od=sund, /limb</span> <span class= code-output > pg_hide, grid_ptd, gd=gd, /disk</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, grid_ptd, color=ctblue()</span>  <span class= code-output > plat_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gd, slon=!dpi/2d, lat=lat, nlon=0)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_hide, plat_ptd[0], cd=cd, gbx=pd[0], /limb</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, plat_ptd[0], psym=3, plabel=strtrim(round(lat*180d/!dpi),2), /label_p</span>  <span class= code-output > plon_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gd, slat=0d, lon=lon, nlat=0)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_hide, plon_ptd[0], cd=cd, gbx=pd[0], /limb</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, plon_ptd[0], psym=3, plabel=strtrim(round(lon*180d/!dpi),2), /label_p</span>  <span class= code-output > dgrid_ptd=pg_grid(gd=gd, bx=rd) & pg_hide, dgrid_ptd, gd=gd, /globe</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, dgrid_ptd, color=ctpurple()</span>   Generate map projections     This section defines a map descriptor for a simple cylindrical projection    using pg_get_maps.  It then calls pg_map to create a map projection and    uses tvim to display it in a new window.  Four different map descriptors    are demonstrated.     We also call pg_grid to calculate a latitude/longitude grid on the map and    then pg_draw to draw the grid in green. For convenience, define a new generic descriptor.    Note that the map descriptor is used for the cd field. Call pg_limb to calculate the limb    on the map and then pg_draw to draw the grid in purple.   Mercator     Map descriptor: <span class= code-output > md = pg_get_maps(/over, bx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >   type='MERCATOR', $</span> <span class= code-output >   ;type='MOLLWEIDE', $</span> <span class= code-output >   fn_data=ptr_new(), $</span> <span class= code-output >   size=[800,400] $</span> <span class= code-output >   )</span>      Stereographic     Map descriptor: <span class= code-output > md = pg_get_maps(/over, bx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >   type='STEREOGRAPHIC', $</span> <span class= code-output >   fn_data=ptr_new(), $</span> <span class= code-output >   scale=0.5, $</span> <span class= code-output >   size=[800,800], $</span> <span class= code-output >   center=[!dpi/2d,0d] $</span> <span class= code-output >   )</span>      Orthographic     Map descriptor: <span class= code-output > md = pg_get_maps(/over, bx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >   type='ORTHOGRAPHIC', $</span> <span class= code-output >   fn_data=ptr_new(), $</span> <span class= code-output >   size=[800,800], $</span> <span class= code-output >   center=[!dpi/6d,!dpi] $</span> <span class= code-output >   ;center=[!dpi/2d,0] $  ; north polar</span> <span class= code-output >   ;center=[-!dpi/2d,0] $ ; south polar</span> <span class= code-output >   )</span>      Rectangular     Map descriptor: <span class= code-output > md = pg_get_maps(/over, bx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >   type='RECTANGULAR', $</span> <span class= code-output >   /graphic,  $</span> <span class= code-output >   fn_data=ptr_new(), $</span> <span class= code-output >   scale=1.0, $</span> <span class= code-output >   ;center=[0d,!dpi],$</span> <span class= code-output >   size=[800,400] $</span> <span class= code-output >   )</span>       Projecting the maps     Use the pg_map and the map descriptor to project the image onto a map.    Certain regions, such as rings, could be excluded from the projection    and ounds on the map can be set, if desired: <span class= code-output > ;to set projection bounds...</span> <span class= code-output > ;bounds = [-30,30,-180,180]*!dpi/180d</span>  <span class= code-output > map = 0</span> <span class= code-output > dd_map = pg_map(dd, md=md, gd=gd, bx=pd[0], map=map, bounds=bounds)</span>  <span class= code-output > ; to exclude areas covered by rings...</span> <span class= code-output > ;dd_map = pg_map(dd, md=md, gd=gd, bx=pd[0], gbx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output > ;          hide_fn='pm_hide_ring', hide_data_p=ptr_new(rd), map=map, bounds=bounds)</span>  <span class= code-output > tvim, /new, map</span>    Call pg_grid to calculate a latitude/longitude grid on the map and    then pg_draw to draw the grid in green.     For convenience, define a new generic descriptor.  Note that the map    descriptor is used for the cd field: <span class= code-output > gdm={cd:md, od:cd, gbx:cor_select(pd,'JUPITER'), dkx:rd}</span>  <span class= code-output > map_grid_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gdm, lat=lat, lon=lon)</span> <span class= code-output > plat_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gdm, slon=!dpi/2d, lat=lat, nlon=0)</span> <span class= code-output > plon_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gdm, slat=0d, lon=lon, nlat=0)</span>  <span class= code-output > pg_draw, map_grid_ptd, col=ctgreen()</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, plat_ptd, psym=7, plabel=strmid(strtrim(lat*180d/!dpi,2),0,3), /label_p</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, plon_ptd, psym=7, plabel=strmid(strtrim(lon*180d/!dpi,2),0,3), /label_p</span>    Call pg_limb to calculate the limb on the map and then pg_draw to    draw the grid in purple: <span class= code-output > map_limb_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gdm)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, map_limb_ptd, col=ctred()</span>  <span class= code-output > map_term_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gdm, od=sund)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, map_term_ptd, col=ctyellow()</span>   Reproject the previous map     A map can be reprojected using a second map descriptor    and the original map descriptor as the camera descriptor: <span class= code-output > md1 = pg_get_maps(/over, bx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >   type='ORTHOGRAPHIC', $</span> <span class= code-output >   ;type='STEREOGRAPHIC', $</span> <span class= code-output >   fn_data=ptr_new(), $</span> <span class= code-output >   size=[800,800], $</span> <span class= code-output >   center=[!dpi/6d,!dpi] $</span> <span class= code-output >   )</span>  <span class= code-output > map=0</span> <span class= code-output > dd_map1 = pg_map(dd_map, md=md1, cd=md, map=map1, bounds=bounds)</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, /new, map1</span>       Output the new state     This section shows how you can save your output.   Output descriptors     These commands write the descriptor information out through the    translators.  The exact behavior is translator-dependent.  The detached    header translator just modifies the detached header (stored in the data    descriptor).

Image read and display  	  	This first section uses dat_read to read in the image.  The image file    c3440346.gem is a Voyager VICAR format file where the image has had    the camera distortions removed with the VICAR program GEOMA.  dat_read    reads the image portion (im) and the image label (label) and its output    is a data descriptor (dd).  ctmod is called to reserve several colors    in the case of an 8-bit display.  tvim is called to display the image    (im) at 1/2 size in a new window with the y coordinate as top-down.  	For Example: <span class= code-output >    dd = dat_read('data/c3440346.gem', im, label)</span> <span class= code-output >  ctmod, top=top</span> <span class= code-output >  tvim, im, zoom=0.5, /order, /new, top=top</span> 	Blah blah    Obtaining the descriptors    	This section obtains the camera descriptor (cd), the planet descriptor   	(pd) and the ring descriptor (rd) for use by the software.

Change override to zero to read the data through the translators using   	the Voyager SEDR instead (assuming you have installed the SEDR data   	files, which are not provided in the default installation).     This example, commented out, shows how two objects can be included in   one planet descriptor.   Filling the generic descriptor    	This line fills a  generic  descriptor.  This is a convenience   	feature where in several descriptors are grouped into a structure that   	can be passed to functions in one piece.    	cd - camera descriptor part   	gbx - globe descriptor part   	dkx - disk descriptor part   Calculating the limb, ring and planet center   Determining the plot characteristics    This section uses pg_limb to calculate the limb point structure (limb_ptd)   containing the limb points, the ring point structure (ring_ptd) and also   the planet center (center_ptd) using the routine pg_center.  It uses the   generic descriptor (gd) to pass the camera, planet and ring descriptors   to these routines.  It also uses pg_hide to remove (/rm) points from the   ring (/disk) from the limb points and then again to remove the ring points   covered by the planet (/globe).  It then groups each of these into   object_ptd for plotting.  The colors, psyms, psizes and plables variables   are defined for the plot.  The center is drawn in the default color   (!p.color), the limb is in yellow (ctyellow) and the inner and outer ring   are in red (ctred).  Here you can see that each ring is treated as two   objects (inner and outer) when defining plot characteristics.  With an   8-bit display, these color routines return the values that were previously   reserved in the color table with ctmod; with a 24-bit display, these   routines return the true color values for these colors.  nlimb stores the   number of points in the limb_ptd structure, nring, the number of points in   the ring point structure.  In plabels, the limb and ring's name is not   plotted since it would be plotted at the center of the object.   Drawing the limb, ring and planet center  	   This section draws the objects in the object structure (center, limb  and ring) with the colors and plot symbols and labels defined earlier.  Notice how the limb and ring curves cut off at the points of intersection  between the objects.   Draw planet and ring latitude/longitude grid  	     This sections calculates a latitude/longitude grid for the planet and a   	radius/longitude grid for the rings.  By default it draws 12 latitude   	and 12 longitude grid lines.  The longitude grid lines circle the body   	and so on a map they will appear as 24 grid lines.  The ring radius grid   	uses four grid lines by default between the inner and outer ring radius.   	It uses pg_hide to set as not visible the points on the grid behind the   	planet and ring for both objects.  It then uses pg_draw to draw the   	planet grid points in blue (ctblue) and the ring grid points in purple   	(ctpurple).  Here is where the example then stops.   Manually repointing the geometry    This pasteable section first clears the screen of the plotted points   by redisplaying the image with tvim.  It then calls pg_drag to allow   the user to use the cursor to drag the pointing, and with it the limb,   ring and planet center.  To move the pointing with pg_drag, use the left   mouse button and translate the pointing in x,y.  Use the middle mouse   button to rotate the pointing about an axis (in this case, the axis of   rotation is set as the planet center (center_ptd[0]).  When the   desired pointing is set, the right mouse button accepts it.  pg_drag   returns the delta x,y amount dragged (dxy) as well as the rotation   angle (dtheta).  pg_repoint uses the dxy and dtheta to update the   camera descriptor (cd, passed by gd).  The limb and center is then   recalculated, the image redisplayed to clear the objects drawn, and   then pg_draw is called to replot.   Scanning the edge to find the limb and using it to calculate the pointing    This section calls pg_cvscan to scan the image around the predicted   limb position and the ring edge position (within width of 80 pixels) and   find the points of highest correlation with a given edge model for each   object (edge_model_nav_limb = limb model used in the VICAR program NAV   and edge_model_nav_ring = ring model from NAV) and zeropoint offset in   the given model (lzero).  These points are then plotted.   Thresholding using correlation coefficient    This section (optional) calls pg_threshold to remove points with lower   correlation coefficients.  The /relative flag means that the minimum   and maximum thresholds are taken as a fraction to the maximum value   in the array.  Notice here again that the ring is treated as two   objects.   Removing regions of bad points    This section (optional) calls pg_select to remove points within a   polygonal region as defined by the cursor.  Click the left mouse   button to mark a point and move the mouse to the next point and   click.  Use the middle mouse button to erase a point and the right   mouse button to end the region.  pg_trim removes the points in the   just defined region.  The scan points are then replotted.   Repeat these statements for each region a user wants to remove.   Fitting the pointing to the scanned points    This section calls pg_cvscan_coeff to determine the linear least-squares   coefficients for a fit to the image coordinate translation and rotation   which matches the computed curve to the scanned curve. It then calls   pg_fit to do the fit with the calculated coefficients to calculate the   correction in translation (dxy) and rotation (dtheta).  It calls   pg_cvchisq to get the chi square of the fit.  Then calls pg_repoint to   update the pointing. Recalculates the limb and center and replots.   The determination of the curves and their subsequent fit can be   iterated on.   Defining a ring sector for a plot    To plot a ring radius vs. intensity or longitude vs. intensity, the   user must first define the limits of the ring sector.  Here it is   done in one of two ways, the first is to define the longitude (lon)   and radius (rad) limits in an array.  The second method is to use   the cursor to sweep out a ring sector, pg_ring_sector is called to   do this.  To use the mouse, click in one corner of your desired sector   and move the cursor to the opposite corner.  In this example,   counterclockwise is the direction of increasing longitude.  The chosen   sector is then calculated using pg_profile_ring with the /outline   keyword.  This outline is then drawn with pg_draw.   Plotting ring sector plots    		Below is the code for four different types of plots using pg_profile_ring.   		Radial (default) and longitudinal (/azimuthal), interpolated (default)   		and binned (/bin).  There is an oversamp keyword which defines the amount   		to oversample (vs. 1 pixel).  In the case of a longitudinal bin scan,   		pixelization can cause some bins to contain very low numbers or none at   		all.  In this example oversamp=0.3 to cause the plot to have larger bins   		to help alleviate this problem.  The calculated profile is then plotted   		in a new window.   Draw planet and ring latitude/longitude grid    This sections calculates a latitude/longitude grid for each planet and a   radius/longitude grid for the rings.  By default it draws 12 latitude   and 12 longitude grid lines.  The longitude grid lines circle the body   and so on a map they will appear as 24 grid lines.  The ring radius grid   uses four grid lines by default between the inner and outer ring radius.   It uses pg_hide to set as not visible the points on the grid behind the   planet and ring for both objects.  It then uses pg_draw to draw the   grid points in blue (ctblue).

N1456251768_1.IMG: Cassini ISS-NA image, obtained from the PDS imaging  	node.   dat_read reads the image portion (im) and the image label (label) and its  output is a data descriptor (dd). tvim is called to display the image (im)  at 3/4 size in a new window with the y coordinate as top-down.   Note: Users with a 24-bit display, you may want to do the device command  'pseudo=8' so that xloadct can be used to contrast enhance the image.

In this example, if the Voyager image is chosen, the default translators  are skipped to use a SEDR update from a VICAR program called NAV instead  of using the normal SEDR the regular translator would return.   If the Cassini image is chosen, this option will be ignored.   Code: <span class= code-output >; Voyager descriptor-generating code</span> <span class= code-output >;cd = pg_get_cameras(dd, 'sedr_source=NAV')</span> <span class= code-output >;pd = pg_get_planets(dd, od=cd, 'sedr_source=NAV')</span> <span class= code-output >;rd = pg_get_rings(dd, pd=pd, od=cd, 'sedr_source=NAV')</span> <span class= code-output >; Cassini descriptor-generating code</span> <span class= code-output >cd = pg_get_cameras(dd)</span> <span class= code-output >pd = pg_get_planets(dd, od=cd)</span> <span class= code-output >rd = pg_get_rings(dd, pd=pd, od=cd)</span>   Filling the generic descriptor   This line fills a  generic  descriptor, which is a standard IDL struct.  Generic descriptors are a convenient notation for several descriptors to  be grouped into a structure that can be passed to functions in one piece.   The components of the generic descriptor are: <span class= code-output >cd - camera descriptor part</span> <span class= code-output >gbx - globe descriptor part</span> <span class= code-output >dkx - disk descriptor part</span>  Code: <span class= code-output >gd = {cd:cd, gbx:pd, dkx:rd}</span>   Filling the star descriptor   This line fills a star descriptor by reading the star catalog using  pg_get_stars. pg_get_stars calls back-end functions to read the  translator table. Therefore, for a specific instrument (for instance,  both ISS-NA and ISS-WA), the star catalog should be specified. The  translators.tab for this demo (in data/translators.tab) should contain  a line with the star catalog to be used: <span class= code-output > -   strcat_tycho2_input     -       /j2000    # or /b1950 if desired</span>  This line specifies that the tycho2 catalog should be used, and all  coordinates should be for the j2000 epoch. Likewise, such a line should  be included in the translator for any mission to be processed.   NOTES:   If the keyword 'tr_override' is specified, only the specified   translator is called instead of whatever star catalog   translators are listed in the translators table.    The translator keyword 'faint' selects only stars with magnitudes   brighter than 14.  The keyword, 'bright' may be used place an upper   bound on the brightness.    /no_sort suppresses the default behavior of returning only   the first object found with any given name.  That operation can be   very time consuming when a large number of objects are returned   by the translators.  In the first case, we have specified that only one   translator will be called, and we know that it will not return   duplicate objects.   Code: <span class= code-output >;sd = pg_get_stars(dd, od=cd, /no_sort, tr_ov='strcat_gsc2_input', 'faint=8')</span> <span class= code-output >sd = pg_get_stars(dd, od=cd, 'faint=14')</span>   Calculating the star centers   The star centers are calculated using pg_center. bx is an output  keyword which contains the body descriptor, in this case it is an  array of star descriptors. Each star descriptor describes the  data for one star.   pg_hide is called to remove (/rm) any star points covered by the  planet (/globe). Although there is no planet in the Cassini image,  this technique should be used to hide star points in general, were  there to be a limb_ptd.   Determining the plot characteristics   The star elements are chosen to be red, with a symbol type of *  (code 2), a font size of 2, and labels corresponding to the name of  each star.

It then calls pg_drag to allow  the user to use the cursor to drag the pointing, and with it the stars.  To move the pointing with pg_drag, use the left mouse button and  translate the pointing in x,y.  Use the middle mouse button to rotate  the pointing about an axis (in this case, the axis of rotation is set  as the optic axis of the image (star_ptd) which is defined using the  routine pnt_create_descrptors with the points being the camera optic  axis as returned by the camera library routine cam_oaxis.  When the  desired pointing is set, the right mouse button accepts it.  pg_drag  returns the delta x,y amount dragged (dxy) as well as the rotation  angle (dtheta).  pg_repoint uses the dxy and dtheta to update the  camera descriptor (cd, passed by gd).  The limb, ring and star points  are then recalculated, the image redisplayed to clear the objects drawn,  and then pg_draw is called to replot.

These points are then plotted.   Code: <span class= code-output >ptscan_ptd = pg_ptscan(dd, star_ptd, edge=30, width=40)</span> <span class= code-output >pg_draw, ptscan_ptd, psym=1, col=ctyellow()</span>   Thresholding using correlation coefficient   This section (optional) calls pg_threshold to remove points with lower  correlation coefficients.  This example only keeps stars with a  correlation coefficient above 0.6.  Notice that each object can have  its own min and max value.   Code: <span class= code-output >pg_threshold, ptscan_ptd, min=make_array(n_stars,val=0.6), $</span> <span class= code-output >                          max=make_array(n_stars,val=1.0)</span> <span class= code-output >tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output >pg_draw, object_ptd, colors=colors, psyms=psyms, psizes=psizes, plabel=plabels</span> <span class= code-output >pg_draw, ptscan_ptd, psym=1, col=ctyellow()</span>   Removing regions of bad points   This section (optional) calls pg_select to remove points within a  polygonal region as defined by the cursor.  Click the left mouse  button to mark a point and move the mouse to the next point and  click.  Use the middle mouse button to erase a point and the right  mouse button to end the region.  pg_trim removes the points in the  just defined region.  The scan points are then replotted.  Repeat these statements for each region a user wants to remove.   Code: <span class= code-output >region=pg_select(dd)</span> <span class= code-output >pg_trim, dd, ptscan_ptd, region</span> <span class= code-output >tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output >pg_draw, object_ptd, colors=colors, psyms=psyms, psizes=psizes, plabel=plabels</span> <span class= code-output >pg_draw, ptscan_ptd, psym=1, col=ctyellow()</span>   Fitting the pointing to the found stars   This section calls pg_ptscan_coeff to determine the linear  least-squares coefficients for a fit to the image coordinate translation  and rotation which matches the computed positions to the scanned  positions. It then calls pg_fit to do the fit with the calculated  coefficients to calculate the correction in translation (dxy) and  rotation (dtheta).  It calls pg_ptchisq to get the chi square of the  fit.  It then calls pg_repoint to update the pointing.  Recalculates  the limb, rings and stars and replots.   Code: <span class= code-output >optic_ptd = pnt_create_descriptors(points=cam_oaxis(cd))</span> <span class= code-output >ptscan_cf = pg_ptscan_coeff(ptscan_ptd, axis=optic_ptd)</span> <span class= code-output >dxy = pg_fit([ptscan_cf], dtheta=dtheta)</span> <span class= code-output >chisq = pg_chisq(dxy, dtheta, ptscan_ptd, axis=optic_ptd[0])</span> <span class= code-output >covar = pg_covariance([ptscan_cf])</span> <span class= code-output >print, dxy, dtheta*180./!pi, chisq, covar</span> <span class= code-output >pg_repoint, dxy, dtheta, axis=optic_ptd, gd=gd</span> <span class= code-output >star_ptd = pg_center(bx=sd, gd=gd) & pg_hide, star_ptd, gd=gd, /rm, /globe</span> <span class= code-output >tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output >pg_draw, star_ptd, color=color, psym=psym, plabel=plabels</span>   Output the new state   This section (optional) shows how you can save your output: any changes  to the image data into a new file and the new pointing into a detached  header.   Code: <span class= code-output >pg_put_cameras, dd, gd=gd</span> <span class= code-output >dat_write, 'data/c1138223_nv.gem', dd</span>  ", "", "          -1", "");
