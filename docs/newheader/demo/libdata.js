Setup: The instrument detectors, translators and transforms must contain the    RADAR definitions, as is included in demo/data/instrument_detectors.tab,    demo/data/translators.tab, and demo/data/transforms.tab. Since the RADAR    data is in PDS format, the PDS detector and io functions must also be set up    in the corresponding tables, as is in config/tab/filetype_detectors.tab    and config/tab/io.tab.

While GRIFT cheats GRIM out of its object references,   GRAFT corruptly inserts (or grafts) data arrays into a GRIM instance.    The usage demonstrated here is a bit contrived, as one could accomplish   a better result by specifying the desired overlays in the call to GRIM,   as in grim_example, but let's live a little.    This example file can be executed from the UNIX command line using    	ominas graft_example-batch    or from within IDL using    	@graft_example-batch    You can also just paste line-by-line if you want to inspect the variables   at each step.    After the example stops, later code samples in this file may be executed by   pasting them onto the IDL command line.  READ AND DISPLAY IMAGE    Use GRIM to open and display an image: <span class= code-output > grim, './data/n1350122987.2', zoom=0.75, /order</span>   GRIFT    First, GRIFT the data descriptor out of poor old GRIM.  Note that the   returned object is a reference to the same object as GRIM is using.      grift, dd=dd    Be warned that GRIM jealously watches over its objects and updates whenever   it detects any changes, so you can simultaneously operate on objects from   within GRIM and from the command line.  For example, try:  	dat_set_data, dd, rotate(dat_data(dd),7)    GRIM resigns itself to having its data descriptor tampered with and   updates the display accordingly.  Run the same command again if you   want flip the image back.   OBTAIN GEOMETRY    Now compute geometry for this dd.  This is the same business you have   seen in all of the other demos, cd, pd, etc.  Of course, you could have   just had GRIM do this: <span class= code-output > cd = pg_get_cameras(dd, 'ck_in=auto')</span> <span class= code-output > pd = pg_get_planets(dd, od=cd, $</span> <span class= code-output >        name=['JUPITER', 'IO', 'EUROPA', 'GANYMEDE', 'CALLISTO'])</span> <span class= code-output > rd = pg_get_rings(dd, pd=pd, od=cd)</span> <span class= code-output > sund = pg_get_stars(dd, od=cd, name='SUN')</span>   MAKE A GENERIC DESCRIPTOR    And of course we shove everything into a generic descriptor because it   makes everything so much easier: <span class= code-output > gd = {cd:cd, gbx:pd, dkx:rd, sund:sund}</span>   COMPUTE OVERLAY ARRAYS    Same old story;  PG_LIMB, PG_DISK, PG_HIDE, etc.  GRIM would have been   happy to do this for you: <span class= code-output > limb_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd) & pg_hide, limb_ptd, gd=gd, /rm, bx=rd</span> <span class= code-output >           pg_hide, limb_ptd, /assoc, gd=gd, bx=pd, od=sund</span> <span class= code-output > ring_ptd = pg_disk(gd=gd) & pg_hide, ring_ptd, gd=gd, bx=pd</span> <span class= code-output > term_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd, od=gd.sund) & pg_hide, term_ptd, gd=gd, bx=pd, /assoc</span> <span class= code-output > center_ptd = pg_center(gd=gd, bx=pd)</span>   DISPLAY OVERLAYS    Ok, now let's draw those overlays, just like in the PG example.  This   is going to be great: <span class= code-output > pg_draw, center_ptd, col=ctwhite(), psym=1, plabel=cor_name(pd)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, limb_ptd, col=ctyellow()</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, term_ptd, col=ctred()</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, ring_ptd, col=ctorange()</span>   Now let's zoom in and take a look at things.  You can use the mouse wheel   with Ctrl depressed, or you can use one of the Zoom cursor modes, or you   can use the View-&gt;Zoom menu, or the associated keyboard shortcuts if   have your Xdefaults-grim installed; basically just throw a flip-flop at   your computer and you should be able to make this happen.    But wait, where did my overlays go?  Did they ever even exist?  If you   are older than two years of age and have mastered object permanence,   then you probably have this one figured out.  We need a way to draw   these things permanently; some way of GRAFTing them into GRIM...   GRAFT    GRAFT crams the POINT objects into GRIM.  Note that these are entered   as user arrays in GRIM, so they're pretty much second class as far as   GRIM is concerned.  This would have been way better if you had just   specified these as overlays in your call to GRIM.  Now you have wasted   your time and GRIM's.  ", "", "          -1", "");

GRIM is kind of like a fancier TVIM,   where you can do all the standard stuff like zooming, panning, and   all manner of other acts that TVIM would never consent to.  You could   just use it exactly like TVIM, using PG_DRAW/PLOTS to draw overlays,   etc., but then none of your overlays would be permanent.  GRIM   maintains arrays internally, so they hang around as you zoom and pan   all over the place.  GRIM also maintains object descriptors and monitors   them very closely; you can barely sneeze around a descriptor without   GRIM refreshing itself several times.  See GRIM.PRO for information   on usage, or just play around with it.    This example file can be executed from the UNIX command line using    	ominas grim_examples-batch    or from within IDL using    	@grim_examples-batch  EXAMPLE 1:    Read a data descriptor and give it to GRIM.

Note   the /new.  Without it, GRIM will try to update the existing instance.   If you zoom out, you may notice many objects far from the field of view.      grim, /new, file, zoom=0.75, /order, $                 overlay=['planet_center', 'limb', 'terminator', 'ring']   EXAMPLE 3:    Try specifying some explicit planet names.

Read and display image     DAT_READ reads the image portion (im) and the label (label) and returns a    data descriptor (dd) containing the image and label and information obtained    through OMINAS' configuration tables.  If a file exists in the same directory    and with the same name as the image, except with the extension  .dh ,    then it is assumed to be a detached header and it is read as well.     The files w1352097259.1 and n1352037683.2 are Cassini wide- and narrow-    angle frames of Jupiter.  2000r.img and 2100r.img are Galileo SSI    images of Ganymede.     TVIM is called to display the image (im) in a new window with the y    coordinate as top-down: <span class= code-output > files = getenv('OMINAS_DIR')+'/demo/data/'+['n1350122987.2','/n1351469359.2']</span>  <span class= code-output > dd = dat_read(files, count=n)</span>  <span class= code-output > zoom = 0.3</span> <span class= code-output > for i=0, n-1 do tvim, dat_data(dd[i]), zoom=zoom, /order, /new</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, /list, wnum=ww</span>              Get camera, planets, rings and sun objects: <span class= code-output > _gd = {cd:obj_new(), gbx:obj_new(), dkx:obj_new(), sund:obj_new()}</span> <span class= code-output > gd = replicate(_gd, n)</span>  <span class= code-output > for i=0, n-1 do gd[i].cd = pg_get_cameras(dd[i])</span> <span class= code-output > for i=0, n-1 do gd[i].gbx = pg_get_planets(dd[i], od=gd[i].cd, name='JUPITER')</span> <span class= code-output > for i=0, n-1 do gd[i].dkx = pg_get_rings(dd[i], pd=gd[i].gbx, od=gd[i].cd)</span> <span class= code-output > for i=0, n-1 do gd[i].sund = pg_get_stars(dd[i], od=gd[i].cd, name='SUN')</span>    Compute limb: <span class= code-output > limb_ptd = objarr(n)</span> <span class= code-output > for i=0, n-1 do limb_ptd[i] = pg_limb(gd=gd[i])</span>   Navigate on limbs automatically     PG_FARFIT finds the limb to within a few pixels.

The SAR data file used, BIFQI22N068_D045_T003S01_V02.IMG, is too large (202 MB)    to include with the OMINAS distribution. This script will look for the file    under ~/ominas_data/sar/, and if not found, will download it from    PDS&lt;http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/data/cassini/cassini_orbiter/CORADR_0045/DATA/BIDR/BIFQI22N068_D045_T003S01_V02.ZIP&gt;,    then unzip it.     Setup: The instrument detectors, translators and transforms must contain the    RADAR, ISS and VIMS definitions, as is included in demo/data/instrument_detectors.tab,    demo/data/translators.tab, and demo/data/transforms.tab. The PDS detector    and io functions must also be set up    in the corresponding tables, as is in config/tab/filetype_detectors.tab    and config/tab/io.tab.     This example requires SPICE/Icy to have been setup. It can be run just by doing: <span class= code-output > .run multiinstrument_example</span>    From within an OMINAS IDL session.     Troubleshooting: This example uses ISS, VIMS and RADAR data, so each of these    3 might independently fail. If this example fails, it may be helpful to try first    running the 3 individual instrument's example scripts first: jupiter_example.pro (ISS),    vims_example.pro and radar_example.pro, to see which instruments work in your    setup and which do not.

All PG programs   accept individual descriptor as well as generic descriptors as   arguments.  GBX means any subclass of GLOBE, DKX means any SUBCLASS   of DSK.  These are arguments to the PG programs that we'll be working   with.      gd = {cd:cd, gbx:pd, dkx:rd, sund:sund}    Here are a couple of tips regarding generic descriptors:     1) I never use them like this.     2) They are nevertheless a handy way to keep the full geometry of a       scene in one place, and they're used all over the place way down in       the core.   COMPUTE OVERLAY ARRAYS    Here we compute various overlays using some PG programs.  The overlay   arrays are contained in POINT objects; limb_ptd, ring_ptd, etc.  Note   that the generic descriptor does not always contain enough information   to get the job done.  PG_CENTER requires an explicit bx (arbitrary body)   argument to tell it which of the bodies in gd are intended.  PG_HIDE   hide the given points with respect to whatever bodies you give it.      limb_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd, count=nlimb) & pg_hide, limb_ptd, gd=gd     ring_ptd = pg_disk(gd=gd, count=nring) & pg_hide, ring_ptd, gd=gd     shadow_ptd = pg_shadow_globe(gd=gd, ring_ptd)     center_ptd = pg_center(gd=gd, bx=pd)    PUT THE OVERLAYS IN ONE ARRAY    I seriously never do things this way, but I guess it illustrates various   ways to use the software.  We're putting all of the POINT objects into   one array, and making corresponding arrays for the colors, plotting   symbols, etc.    The CT programs are used to get color indices for some basic colors   without having to know what type of visual class you're using.      object_ptd = [center_ptd,limb_ptd,ring_ptd,shadow_ptd]     colors = [!p.color,ctyellow(),ctred(),ctred(),ctblue()]     psyms=[1,3,3,3,3]     psizes=[0.5]     plabels = [cor_name(pd), '', '']    DRAW EVERYTHING  	    PG_DRAW is the basic program for drawing overlays in OMINAS.  It does   the same thing as PLOTS (which you could use instead), but it accepts   POINT objects are arguments and allows you to use specify multiple colors   symbols, etc.  PG_DRAW also accepts raw points arrays (i.e. 2 x np).      pg_draw, object_ptd, $                 colors=colors, psyms=psyms, psizes=psizes, plabel=plabels    MAKE IT OFFICIAL BY ADDING GRIDS  	    PG_GRID will put a grid on just about anything.  At least anything   with a surface described by two angle-like coordinates: a planet, a map,   the sky, a disk (in that case, the radius is one of the coordinates), etc.   Those kinds of coordinate systems are referred to as surface coordinate   systems in OMINAS.  Because their representations are analogous, their   corresponding objects can be pretty much interchanged all over the place.   This is such a place.  On that topic, coordinate systems using image   points (i.e., CAMERA and MAP image systems) are similarly interchangeable.      grid_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gd, bx=pd)        pg_hide, grid_ptd, gd=gd, bx=pd, /assoc        pg_hide, grid_ptd, gd=gd, bx=rd     pg_draw, grid_ptd, color=ctblue()     dgrid_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gd, bx=rd) & pg_hide, dgrid_ptd, gd=gd, bx=pd    pg_draw, dgrid_ptd, color=ctpurple()    DEFINE A RING SECTOR    Let's define a sector so we can make a plot of intensity vs. radius   or longitude.  First, we'll specify the longitude and radius limits   explicitly.  Note that we're working in meters here because all of our   inputs for the descriptors were in meters.  Units in OMINAS are   determined by the translators.  Of course, all angles are in radians.      lon = [175,177] * !dpi/180d     rad = [65000,138000] * 1000d     tvim,im     outline_ptd = pg_ring_sector(gd=gd, rad=rad, lon=lon)     pg_draw, outline_ptd, col=ctgreen()    MANUALLY DEFINE A RING SECTOR    You can also define the ring sector using the mouse.  Just leave out   the bounds in the call to PG_RING_SECTOR.  Have we fixed that thing   where the sector wraps around wrong?  You'd think so by now.      tvim,im     outline_ptd = pg_ring_sector(gd=gd)     pg_draw, outline_ptd, col=ctgreen()               PLOT INTENSITY VS. RADIUS AND LONGITUDE    The POINT object returned by PG_RING_SECTOR can be used as an input   to PG_PROFILE_RING to produce radial and azimuthal profiles.   PG_PROFILE_RING returns a data descriptor containing the plot.  It   also outputs the profile itself and the disk coordinates of each point   in the profile so you don't have to dereference the data descriptor.    Radial scan: <span class= code-output >  .. image:: graphics/saturn_sector_2.jpeg</span>  <span class= code-output > dd_prof = pg_profile_ring(dd, gd=gd, outline_ptd, $</span> <span class= code-output >                                         dsk_pts=dsk_pts, profile=profile)</span> <span class= code-output > window, /free, xs=500, ys=300</span> <span class= code-output > plot, dsk_pts[*,0], profile</span>    Azimuthal scan:            dd_prof = pg_profile_ring(dd, gd=gd, outline_ptd, /azimuthal, $                                             dsk_pts=dsk_pts, profile=profile)     window, /free, xs=500, ys=300     plot, dsk_pts[*,1], profile, /yno   ", "", "          -1", "");
  

libdata[libdataItem++] = new Array("./pg_example-batch.html", "pg_example-batch.pro", '.pro file in <a href="./dir-overview.html">./ directory</a>', "pg_example-batch.pro", "", "", "                              PG EXAMPLE    Created by Joe Spitale   Edited by Mark Moretto for manual     This example demonstrates various capabilities of the PG programming    interface, OMINAS' command-line API.  It can be executed from the UNIX    command line using: <span class= code-output > ominas pg_example-batch</span>  <span class= code-output >or from within an OMINAS IDL session using:</span> <span class= code-output >@pg_example-batch</span>     After the example stops, later code samples in this file may be executed by     pasting them onto the IDL command line.   READ AND DISPLAY IMAGE        Use DAT_READ to read the image and then display the image using TVIM.    With DAT_READ, it is not necessary to specify the file format.  DAT_READ    uses your file type detectors to determine the format, and gets the    appropriate reader from your I/O table.  DAT_READ returns a data    descriptor (dd), which contains all of the data associated with the file.    For convenience, it also returns the data array (im) and header (label)    in its second and third arguments.     TVIM is called to display the image (im) in a new window with the y    coordinate as top-down: <span class= code-output > dd = dat_read('./demo/data/N1350122987_2.IMG', im, label)</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, im, zoom=0.75, /order, /new</span>   OBTAIN GEOMETRY     This section obtains the geometric information describing the scene.    Note that there is no reference to the source of the this information.    That is handled by the translator system, which is controlled by    a series of translators tables telling OMINAS which translators to use    for a given instrument.  The translators tables are parsed by DAT_READ,    which stores the list of translators in the data descriptor.     If you are using the default demo configuration, then the geometry    data are obtained via the NAIF/SPICE translator package and the detached    header package.  The NAIF/SPICE translators use database files    provided by NAIF or by individual projects.  The detached header    translators read and write geometry descriptors in a text-based file    that resides in the same directory as the data file and has the    extension '.dh'.  Because the detached header translator dh_std_input    appears before the Cassini Spice input translator in the default    translators table, the descriptors are taken from the detached header    if it exists, and if the relevant descriptors are present.  Otherwise,    they are obtained from the SPICE kernels.       cd = pg_get_cameras(dd)                        ; CAMERA descriptor      pd = pg_get_planets(dd, od=cd, count=npd)      ; PLANET descriptor(s)      rd = pg_get_rings(dd, pd=pd, od=cd, count=nrd) ; RING descriptor(s)      sund = pg_get_stars(dd, od=cd, name='SUN')     ; STAR descriptor for Sun     The calls to PG_GET_PLANETS, PG_GET_RINGS, and PG_GET_STARS include    an observer descriptor, od.  Without this, it would not be possible    to perform aberration corrections on the returned objects.  In that    case, the returned descriptors would represent the real states of the    bodies at the time of observation at their respective positions rather    than from the point of view of the observer.     Note the 'name' keyword in the call to PG_GET_STARS. This is a CORE    attribute, so it may be applied to any body.  For example, if you are    only interested in Jupiter and the Galilean satellites, you could    write: <span class= code-output > pd = pg_get_planets(dd, od=cd, $</span> <span class= code-output >          name=['JUPITER', 'IO', 'EUROPA', 'GANYMEDE', 'CALLISTO'])</span>   INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC USAGE     It is possible to communicate directly with the translators from the    PG API via the use of translator keywords.  Translator keywords are    keyword=value strings that are passed directly to the translator system    with no interpretation by OMINAS.  They may be permanently coded in    the translators table to be passed to a specific translator, or    transient inputs may be provided to the PG_GET_* programs as a string    argument.  In the latter case, they are accessible to all translators    pertaining to that PG_GET_* program and they precede translator keywords    from the translators table.     Here are some examples of controlling the NAIF/SPICE interface in a    call to PG_GET_CAMERAS: <span class= code-output > cd = pg_get_cameras(dd, 'klist=my_klist.txt')     ; Use personal kernel</span> <span class= code-output >                                                   ; list file.</span>  <span class= code-output > cd = pg_get_cameras(dd, 'ck_in=./test.bc')        ; Use a specified C kernel.</span>  <span class= code-output > cd = pg_get_cameras(dd, 'ck_in=./auto')           ; Use the C-kernel auto-</span> <span class= code-output >                                                   ; detect function.</span>  <span class= code-output > cd = pg_get_cameras(dd, 'klist=my_klist.txt, $    ; Multiple arguments</span> <span class= code-output >                          ck_in=test.bc;test1.bc') ; separated by commas;</span> <span class= code-output >                                                   ; multiple elements</span> <span class= code-output >                                                   ; separated by semicolons.</span>   MAKE A GENERIC DESCRIPTOR     Here we go with the generic descriptors again.  The story with these    things is that long ago before GRIM was summoned from the lowest levels    of heck, OMINAS (or MINAS, or NV) was purely command-based.  That's    what you want because you can always build a GUI on top of it, but    it doesn't really work to start with a graphical tool and try to    build a command-based system out of that.  Therefore, I decided to have    mercy on the poor jerks (mostly me up to now) who had to type (really    paste) all of this nonsense in.  The generic descriptor was therefore    spawned as a way to cut down on all the cd=this, pd=that, bx=whatever    that tends to go on.  So we just shove it all into one structure and    all of the PG programs know to look in there if one is given.  Any    explicit descriptor arguments take precedence, though.  So if these    things make you happy, then you're welcome.  I rarely use them in this    way.  They live on because it turns out they have amazing utility in    other ways.  So anyway, it's like this: <span class= code-output > gd = {cd:cd, gbx:pd, dkx:rd, sund:sund}</span>   COMPUTE OVERLAY ARRAYS     These commands compute the center, limb, and terminator of each planet,    as well as the edges of the rings.  Note that the terminator is computed    using PG_LIMB with the Sun as the observer.: <span class= code-output > limb_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd) & pg_hide, limb_ptd, gd=gd, bx=rd, /rm</span> <span class= code-output >           pg_hide, limb_ptd, /assoc, gd=gd, bx=pd, od=sund</span> <span class= code-output > ring_ptd = pg_disk(gd=gd) & pg_hide, ring_ptd, gd=gd, bx=pd</span> <span class= code-output > term_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd, od=gd.sund) & pg_hide, term_ptd, gd=gd, bx=pd, /assoc</span> <span class= code-output > center_ptd = pg_center(gd=gd, bx=pd)</span>   SET UP FOR PLOTTING    This just makes the calls to PG_DRAW a little easier, since they will   need to be repeated every time we change things and recompute.  We put   all of the POINT descriptors in one array and then make corresponding   arrays for the plot parameters.      object_ptd = [center_ptd,limb_ptd,ring_ptd,term_ptd]     colors=[make_array(npd,value=!p.color), $             make_array(npd,value=ctyellow()), $             make_array(2*nrd,value=ctred()), $             make_array(npd,value=ctgreen())]     psyms=[make_array(npd,value=1), $            make_array(npd,value=3), $            make_array(2*nrd,value=3), $            make_array(npd,value=3)]     psizes=1.0     csizes=0.75     plabels=[cor_name(pd), $             make_array(npd,value=''), $             make_array(2*nrd,value=''), $             make_array(npd,value='')]   DRAW EVERYTHING      Now we can do a nice simple call to PG_DRAW to draw everything: <span class= code-output >   pg_draw, object_ptd, $</span> <span class= code-output >             col=colors, psy=psyms, psi=psizes, csi=csizes, pl=plabels</span>   FIRST-CUT AUTOMATIC REPOINTING     Refine the pointing of the spacecraft by using PG_FARFIT, which searches    the image for a pattern matching the edges calculated using the    geometry descriptors.  First scan the images for edges, ignoring the    a 10-pixel zone at the edge of the image: <span class= code-output > edge_ptd = pg_edges(dd, edge=10)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, edge_ptd</span>          Next, use PG_FARFIT to find the x/y offset that best matches the limb of    planet 0 (which is Jupiter because the translators return the observation    target as number 0 if it is known): <span class= code-output > dxy = pg_farfit(dd, edge_ptd, [limb_ptd[0]])</span>    BTW, you have been duped.  PG_FARFIT fails a lot because the search    is pretty sparse.  We cherry-picked an image that usually works pretty    well.  The sparse search makes PG_FARFIT pretty fast, though.  Ok,    now repoint using the farfit solution: <span class= code-output > pg_repoint, dxy, gd=gd</span>    Now that the camera pointing has changed, everything has to be recomputed,    just like before:  <span class= code-output >limb_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd) & pg_hide, limb_ptd, gd=gd, bx=rd, /rm</span> <span class= code-output >       pg_hide, limb_ptd, /assoc, gd=gd, bx=pd, od=sund</span> <span class= code-output >ring_ptd = pg_disk(gd=gd) & pg_hide, ring_ptd, gd=gd, bx=pd</span> <span class= code-output >center_ptd = pg_center(gd=gd, bx=pd)</span> <span class= code-output >term_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gd, od=gd.sund) & pg_hide, term_ptd, gd=gd, bx=pd, /assoc</span> <span class= code-output >object_ptd = [center_ptd,limb_ptd,ring_ptd,term_ptd]</span>    And now we can see the result:      tvim, im     pg_draw, object_ptd, $                 colors=colors, psyms=psyms, psizes=psizes, plabel=plabels         MANUALLY REPOINT THE GEOMETRY     If you have a little time, you can just drag the pointing around    by hand.  We just need to get it close enough to really nail down in    the next section.  There's a good chance PG_FARFIT really dropped    the ball on the last step anyway.  Just paste this in and follow    the directions: <span class= code-output >tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output >dxy = pg_drag(object_ptd, dtheta=dtheta, axis=center_ptd[0])</span>    Like PG_FARFIT, PG_DRAG returns an x/y offset that can be input to    PG_REPOINT, but it also returns a twist offset, so we need to input    that and an axis to PG_REPOINT: <span class= code-output >pg_repoint, dxy, dtheta, axis=center_ptd[0], gd=gd</span>    And now you have to recompute and redraw again.  It's the same as    above.  Please don't make me write it out.   PRECISE EDGE SCAN     Not satisfied with PG_FARFIT?  I wouldn't be, it's just not a sub-pixel    kind of thing.  Sometimes its results can be very super-pixel.  However,    once we get within a few tens of pixels of the correct pointing, we can    use PG_CVSCAN to pick up the edges with a more rigorous algorithm.    PG_CVSCAN scans around a predicted edge (in this case Jupiter's limb)    comparing the brightness profile with a model profile.  In this case,    we use the limb edge model developed by Gary Yagi and used in the old    VICAR NAV program (Ugh, remember VICAR?  That's kind of the whole reason    we're doing any of this).  Indeed this whole CVSCAN business is the same    exact algorithm that Andy Ingersoll scribbled down on a piece of paper    sometime in the 1980s, just gussied up and vectorized with a bunch of    pg_this and gd_that and all manner of other whatnot.     Anyway, here we are staying 30 pixels from the image edge, and scanning    with a width of 80 pixels.  The lzero and mzero are coordinating the    zero pointing of the model: <span class= code-output >cvscan_ptd=pg_cvscan(dd, gd=gd, limb_ptd[0], edge=30, width=80, $</span> <span class= code-output >   model=[make_array(npd,val=ptr_new(edge_model_nav_limb(zero=lzero)))], $</span> <span class= code-output >   mzero=[make_array(npd,val=lzero)] )</span>    And then we draw the points: <span class= code-output >tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output >pg_draw, cvscan_ptd</span>         THRESHOLD ON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT     This section calls pg_threshold to remove points with unacceptable    correlation coefficients.  The /relative flag means that the minimum    and maximum thresholds are taken as a fraction of the maximum    correlation coefficient for each set of points. In this case we use    a minimum correlation coefficient of 0.81 and a maximum of 1.0: <span class= code-output > pg_threshold, cvscan_ptd, min=0.81, max=1.0, /rel</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, cvscan_ptd</span>   MANUALLY EDIT THE SCANNED POINTS     PG_SELECT is used to manually remove points within a polygonal region    defined by the cursor.  PG_TRIM removes the points in the defined    region: <span class= code-output > region = pg_select(dd)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_trim, dd, cvscan_ptd, region</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, im</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, cvscan_ptd</span>   SUB-PIXEL POINTING CORRECTION     PG_CVSCAN_COEFF determines the linear least-squares coefficients for a    fit to the image coordinate translation and rotation that matches the    computed curve to the scanned curve.  PG_FIT uses the resulting    coefficients to calculate the corrections.  In this case, we fix    the rotation offset (fix=2) because the limb gives little leverage on    that parameter: <span class= code-output >cvscan_cf = pg_cvscan_coeff(cvscan_ptd, fix=2)</span> <span class= code-output >dxy = pg_fit(cvscan_cf)</span>    The reason that these two programs are separate is that a simultaneous    fit can be performed by simply adding all of the linear coefficients.    If PG_FIT is given an array of coefficient structures, it will add them    before performing the fit, so, for example, you could compute coefficients    to fit stars in the image (using PG_PTSCAN), and include them in the    call to PG_FIT to get a simultaneous fit to the stars and the limb.     Once again, you need to recompute and redraw to see the new pointing:        FIT STATISTICS     You can get the statistics using PG_CHISQ and PG_COVARIANCE: <span class= code-output >chisq = pg_chisq(dxy, 0, cvscan_ptd, fix=2)</span> <span class= code-output >covar = pg_covariance(cvscan_cf)</span> <span class= code-output >print, dxy, dtheta*180./!pi, chisq, covar</span>   PLANET AND RING LATITUDE/LONGITUDE GRID        This section calculates a latitude/longitude grid for each planet and a    radius/longitude grid for the rings.  By default it draws 12 latitude    and 12 longitude grid lines.  The longitude grid lines circle the body    and so on a map they will appear as 24 grid lines.  The ring radius grid    uses four grid lines by default between the inner and outer ring radius.    It uses PG_HIDE to set as not visible the points on the grid behind the    planet and ring for both objects.  It then uses PG_DRAW to draw the    grid points in blue (ctblue): <span class= code-output > grid_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gd, lat=lat, lon=lon)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_hide, grid_ptd, cd=cd, bx=pd, /assoc</span> <span class= code-output > pg_hide, grid_ptd, cd=cd, bx=pd, od=sund, /assoc</span> <span class= code-output > pg_hide, grid_ptd, gd=gd, bx=rd</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, grid_ptd, color=ctblue()</span>  <span class= code-output > plat_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gd, slon=!dpi/2d, lat=lat, nlon=0)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_hide, plat_ptd[0], cd=cd, bx=pd[0], /, bx=pd</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, plat_ptd[0], psym=3, plabel=strtrim(round(lat*180d/!dpi),2), /label_p</span>  <span class= code-output > plon_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gd, slat=0d, lon=lon, nlat=0)</span> <span class= code-output > pg_hide, plon_ptd[0], cd=cd, bx=pd[0], /assoc</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, plon_ptd[0], psym=3, plabel=strtrim(round(lon*180d/!dpi),2), /label_p</span>  <span class= code-output > dgrid_ptd=pg_grid(gd=gd, bx=rd) & pg_hide, dgrid_ptd, gd=gd, bx=pd</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, dgrid_ptd, color=ctpurple()</span>   MAP DESCRIPTORS     PG_GET_MAPS is used to define map descriptors for various projections.    Paste the one you want:  <span class= code-output >Rectangular:</span> <span class= code-output > md = pg_get_maps(/over, bx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >        projection='RECTANGULAR', $</span> <span class= code-output >        /map_graphic,</span> <span class= code-output >        size=[400,200])</span>  <span class= code-output >     .. image:: graphics/jupiter_rectangular.jpeg</span>      Orthographic: <span class= code-output >  md = pg_get_maps(/over, bx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >        projection='ORTHOGRAPHIC', $</span> <span class= code-output >        size=[400,400], $</span> <span class= code-output >        center=[!dpi/6d,!dpi])</span>  <span class= code-output >     .. image:: graphics/jupiter_orthographic.jpeg</span>      Stereographic: <span class= code-output >  md = pg_get_maps(/over, bx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >         projection='STEREOGRAPHIC', $</span> <span class= code-output >         scale=0.5, $</span> <span class= code-output >         size=[400,400], center=[!dpi/2d,0d])</span>  <span class= code-output >     .. image:: graphics/jupiter_stereographic.jpeg</span>      Mercator: <span class= code-output >  md = pg_get_maps(/over, bx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >        projection='MERCATOR', $</span> <span class= code-output >         size=[400,200])</span>  <span class= code-output >     .. image:: graphics/jupiter_mercator.jpeg</span>   MAP PROJECTIONS     PG_MAP creates a map projection and returns it in a data descriptor.    The map is also returned a a keyword for convenience: <span class= code-output > dd_map = pg_map(dd, md=md, gd=gd, bx=pd[0], map=map)</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, /new, map</span>  <span class= code-output >Rectangular:</span> <span class= code-output >     .. image:: graphics/jupiter_rectangular.jpeg</span>     Orthographic: <span class= code-output >     .. image:: graphics/jupiter_orthographic.jpeg</span>     Stereographic: <span class= code-output >     .. image:: graphics/jupiter_stereographic.jpeg</span>     Mercator: <span class= code-output >     .. image:: graphics/jupiter_mercator.jpeg</span>     You could bound the map like this: <span class= code-output > dd_map = pg_map(dd, md=md, gd=gd, bx=pd[0], map=map, $</span> <span class= code-output >                  bounds=bounds = [-30,30,-180,180]*!dpi/180d)</span>     Or exclude the areas covered by the rings: <span class= code-output > dd_map = pg_map(dd, md=md, gd=gd, bx=pd[0], gbx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >                    hide_fn='pm_hide_ring', hide_bx=rd, map=map)</span>   PUT A GRID ON IT     PG_GRID computes a latitude/longitude grid.  This is the same program    used in other examples to draw grids on other things; here we're    using a map descriptor instead of a camera descriptor.     First, define a new generic descriptor.  : <span class= code-output > gdm={cd:md, od:cd, gbx:pd[0], dkx:rd}</span>  <span class= code-output > map_grid_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gdm, lat=lat, lon=lon)</span> <span class= code-output > plat_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gdm, slon=!dpi/2d, lat=lat, nlon=0)</span> <span class= code-output > plon_ptd = pg_grid(gd=gdm, slat=0d, lon=lon, nlat=0)</span>  <span class= code-output > pg_draw, map_grid_ptd, col=ctgreen()</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, plat_ptd, psym=7, plabel=strmid(strtrim(lat*180d/!dpi,2),0,3), /label_p</span> <span class= code-output > pg_draw, plon_ptd, psym=7, plabel=strmid(strtrim(lon*180d/!dpi,2),0,3), /label_p</span>   OBSERVATION-SPECIFIC OVERLAYS     Use PG_LIMB to compute a limb and a terminator by specifying an    observer descriptor.      map_limb_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gdm, od=cd)     map_term_ptd = pg_limb(gd=gdm, od=sund)      pg_draw, map_limb_ptd, col=ctred()     pg_draw, map_term_ptd, col=ctyellow()    MAP-TO-MAP PROJECTION     A map can be reprojected using a second map descriptor with the    original map descriptor in place of the camera descriptor: <span class= code-output > md1 = pg_get_maps(/over, bx=pd[0], $</span> <span class= code-output >    projection='ORTHOGRAPHIC', $</span> <span class= code-output >    size=[400,400], $</span> <span class= code-output >    center=[!dpi/6d,!dpi])</span>  <span class= code-output > dd_map1 = pg_map(dd_map, md=md1, cd=md, map=map1)</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, /new, map1</span>       OUTPUT DESCRIPTORS     These commands write the descriptor information out through the    translators.  The exact behavior is translator-dependent.  In the default    configuration, the detached header translator modifies the detached header    stored in the data descriptor.  It is not written until DAT_WRITE is called.       pg_put_rings, dd, od=cd, rd=rd      pg_put_planets, dd, od=cd, pd=pd      pg_put_cameras, dd, cd=cd      pg_put_stars, dd, sd=sund, od=cd     The detached head may be viewed using: <span class= code-output > print, transpose(dat_dh(dd))</span>    If using the NAIF/SPICE translator, a C kernel may be written by    specifying a file name using the ck_out translator keyword.  A comment    can be included in the output kernel by making a user data value    named  CK_COMMENT : <span class= code-output > cor_set_udata, cd, 'CK_COMMENT', 'This is a comment.'</span> <span class= code-output > pg_put_cameras, dd, cd=cd, 'ck_out=./outputs/test.bc'</span>   WRITE DATA FILE     DAT_WRITE writes the data array in the data descriptor using whatever    output function was given in the I/O table.  The detached header is    is also written into a file with the same name as the image file except    with the extension '.dh'.  If this file does not already exist, it is    created.       dat_write, './outputs/' + cor_name(dd), dd    WRITE MAP FILE     PG_PUT_MAPS causes the detached header translator to generate a new    detached header and write the map descriptor into it.     As above, DAT_WRITE writes the map image file and the detached header.    Notice that the file type is given explicitly because the data descriptor    was not created by DAT_READ, which would have detected the file type: <span class= code-output > pg_put_maps, dd_map, md=md</span> <span class= code-output > dat_write, './outputs/' + cor_name(dd) + '.map', dd_map, filetype = 'VICAR'</span>    To read the new map file, use DAT_READ just as the image file was read at    the beginning of this example script.  To read the map descriptor from the    detached header, use PG_GET_MAPS: <span class= code-output > dd_map = dat_read(./outputs/&lt;nme&gt;.map', map)</span> <span class= code-output > md = pg_get_maps(dd_map)</span> <span class= code-output > tvim, /new, map</span>  ", "", "          -1", "");
